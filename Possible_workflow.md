Creating a cross-lingual TTS model with data in Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati can be approached effectively by following these steps. Given the similar phonological features across these languages (they share many phonetic characteristics from the Indo-Aryan language family), you can leverage phoneme-based or phonological-feature-based models to transfer knowledge across languages.

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up and training a cross-lingual TTS model:

Step 1: Preprocess Data with Phoneme and Phonological Feature Mapping
Convert Text to Phonemes:

Use a grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) converter to convert the text into phoneme sequences for each language.
Tools like g2p or Phonemizer can generate phonemes based on language-specific rules, which will be more consistent across languages than direct graphemes.
Map Phonemes to Phonological Features:

To make the model more language-agnostic, map each phoneme to articulatory features like vowel openness, frontness, and consonantal properties.
This approach enables phonological similarity between languages to help the model generalize better in cross-lingual scenarios, particularly useful for low-resource settings like Gujarati.
Speaker Embeddings:

Extract speaker embeddings (e.g., using pretrained d-vectors or x-vectors) if you want your TTS model to adapt to different speaker voices across languages.
If you're using a multispeaker dataset, assign each speaker an ID and embed it as a speaker embedding vector.
Step 2: Choose a TTS Model Architecture
For a cross-lingual TTS system, consider architectures like Tacotron2, FastSpeech2, or VITS:

Tacotron2: Effective for high-quality synthesis with moderate resources, but slower during inference.
FastSpeech2: Faster inference speed and robustness to variable input lengths, useful for deploying TTS models.
VITS (Variational Inference Text-to-Speech): Combines robustness, high-quality synthesis, and flexibility for speaker adaptation.
Here's an example of setting up a cross-lingual TTS model pipeline using Tacotron2 or FastSpeech2:

    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    
    class CrossLingualTTS(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, phonological_dim, speaker_emb_dim, audio_dim):
            super(CrossLingualTTS, self).__init__()
            self.phoneme_encoder = nn.Linear(phonological_dim, 256)
            self.speaker_encoder = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=100, embedding_dim=speaker_emb_dim)
            
            # TTS Decoder
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(256 + speaker_emb_dim, 512)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, audio_dim)
    
        def forward(self, phonological, speaker_id):
            phoneme_features = self.phoneme_encoder(phonological)
            speaker_emb = self.speaker_encoder(speaker_id)
            
            combined = torch.cat([phoneme_features, speaker_emb], dim=-1)
            x = torch.relu(self.fc1(combined))
            audio_out = self.fc2(x)
            return audio_out
            
Phoneme Encoder: Converts phonological feature inputs into embeddings.
Speaker Embedding: Speaker ID embedding, allowing speaker adaptation.
TTS Decoder: Converts combined embeddings into spectrogram frames, which can be converted into waveform using a vocoder (e.g., HiFi-GAN, WaveGlow).
Step 3: Training Strategy
1. Multitask Training with Language Tags:
Add a language embedding to each input (similar to speaker embeddings) to help the model understand language contexts.
During training, pass both speaker and language embeddings along with phonological features to make the model aware of language boundaries.
2. Cross-Lingual Training:
Train the model on Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati samples in the same batch or alternate batches to ensure it learns cross-lingual embeddings.
Use gradient accumulation and mixed-language mini-batches for cross-lingual generalization, making it robust to language changes.
3. Phoneme Augmentation:
Since Hindi, Marathi, and Gujarati share many phonemes, you can augment the training by pairing similar phonemes across languages to create a larger, mixed-language phoneme pool.
Step 4: Training Loop with Loss Function
Use Mel Spectrogram Loss or L1 Loss to compare the generated spectrogram with the target spectrogram.
Add an auxiliary language classification loss to encourage the model to distinguish between languages.

    import torch.optim as optim
    
    def train_tts_model(model, train_loader, num_epochs=10):
        criterion = nn.MSELoss()
        optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
    
        model.train()
        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            total_loss = 0
            for batch in train_loader:
                phonological = batch['phonological']
                speaker_id = batch['speaker_id']
                audio = batch['audio']
                
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                outputs = model(phonological, speaker_id)
                loss = criterion(outputs, audio)
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()
                total_loss += loss.item()
            
            print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {total_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}")

Step 5: Evaluation
Mean Opinion Score (MOS): Conduct human evaluations to obtain MOS for speech naturalness across the three languages.
Word Error Rate (WER): Use an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to transcribe generated audio, then compare it with reference transcriptions to compute WER. This helps assess intelligibility across languages.
Speaker Similarity (Optional): If speaker preservation is essential, use cosine similarity or perceptual tests to evaluate similarity between the target speaker's voice and the generated voice.
